### Tinkering with 5G: New Enclosure Day
We’re officially diving into the 5G version of the MARK node. We’ve settled on a modem, and now start working on the hardware side. It’s not quite as simple as "plug and play"—the move to 5G is forcing us to rethink the enclosure design.

Since we’re dealing with a much denser antenna array this time around, the internal real estate is getting crowded. It’s a bit of a balancing act: we need to find the right placement for the extra antennas to ensure signal integrity while keeping the overall footprint manageable.

Beyond the physical space, the power requirements have changed. 5G modems can be power-hungry, especially under load, so we’re currently tweaking the power supply needs to make sure everything stays cool and stable.

It’s definitely a "back to the CAD files" kind of afternoon, but it’s a necessary step to get the performance we’re looking for. We’ll be running a few 3D prints this week to see how the new layout feels in hand.
