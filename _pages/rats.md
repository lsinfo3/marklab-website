## Comparison of 2G, 3G, LTE Cat-1, LTE-M, and NB-IoT  

A brief overview of different mobile network technologies used in IoT and mobile communications.

### Overview  

- **2G (GSM/GPRS/EDGE)**: One of the earliest mobile communication technologies, designed primarily for voice calls and basic data transfer. It has low data rates and high power consumption.  
- **3G (UMTS/HSPA)**: Introduced higher data speeds, supporting mobile internet and video streaming. However, it consumes more power than later LTE-based technologies.  
- **LTE Cat-1**: A 4G technology that supports both voice and data transmission with decent power efficiency. It is widely used in IoT applications requiring continuous connectivity.  
- **LTE-M (LTE Cat-M1)**: Designed for IoT applications, LTE-M offers low power consumption, good indoor penetration, and moderate data rates. It supports mobility and voice over LTE (VoLTE).  
- **NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)**: Ultra-low-power technology designed for stationary IoT devices, such as smart meters and sensors. It has limited bandwidth but excellent coverage and battery life.  

### Comparison Table  

| Technology  | Uplink Speed | Downlink Speed | Latency       |  
|------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|  
| 2G (EDGE)  | ~240 kbps    | ~300 kbps      | High (~500ms) |  
| 3G (DC-HSPA+)  | ~8 Mbps     | ~42 Mbps      | Moderate (~100ms) |  
| LTE Cat-1  | ~5 Mbps     | ~10 Mbps      | Low (~50ms) |  
| LTE-M      | ~375 kbps     | ~375 kbps       | Low (~50ms) |  
| NB-IoT     | ~66 kbps    | ~26 kbps     | High (~1s) |
