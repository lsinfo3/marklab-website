The KuVS Fachgespräch - Würzburg Workshop on Next-Generation Communication Networks with a special focus on 6G Networks and related technologies (WueWoWAS’24) focuses on preliminary and ongoing research and previously published hot topic papers on next-generation communication networks. General topics include but are not limited to

* 6G architectures and technologies: converged and non-terrestrial networks, specialized networks e.g. industrial or IoT networks, integrated sensing, etc. 
* Concepts for 6G networks: softwarization, edge computing, (explainable) AI and ML, automation, real-time and time-sensitive networking (TSN), etc.
* 6G use cases: industrial manufacturing, robotics, automotive, smart city, etc.
* Evaluation of performance, sustainability, resilience: measurements, modeling, simulation, analysis on QoS, QoE, energy efficiency, etc. as well as means for reproducibility

The workshop will take place in-person in Würzburg, Germany on 30.09.2024 and 01.10.2024. We encourage PhD students, early career scientists as well as senior researchers to contribute early state and ongoing research or previously published hot topic papers in the form of extended abstracts no longer than 3 pages excluding references.

The goal of the workshop is to foster communication among researchers from industry and academia and provide a venue for early feedback. To this end, invited experience talks and discussion slots on important topics in NGN are an integral part of the program.

## Preliminary Program ##

The program will include regular presentation sessions with ample time for questions and discussion. For the first time this year, we are organizing a speedmentoring session with invited experts from academia and industry. Participants will have the opportunity to book slots with each of the invited experts to discuss their own work, recent developments, or other professional matters.
The workshop will start on Monday morning and finish Tuesday afternoon.
Details regarding the workshop program will be provided at a later date.
