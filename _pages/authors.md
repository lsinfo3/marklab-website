# Author Instructions

We invite all authors of accepted submissions to provide a camera ready version of their paper via EDAS by June 10.

We also invite authors, same as all other participants, to register for the workshop via EDAS: [Registration](https://lsinfo3.github.io/WueWoWas2022/registration/)

# At the Workshop

For the workshop in July, we expect all authors of accepted papers to present their work in person. For this, we will provide 30 minute time slots for each presentation and suggest authors prepare 22 minute long talks to leave some room for discussion.

# Tutorial Participation

For those who will participate in the tutorials on Monday, we will provide detailed instructions regarding potential things to prepare ahead of time. In general, we will be working in python and R and discuss how to analyze systems using either analytical or simulative approaches in practice.

In order to make the tutorials as seamless as possible, we suggest to prepare your systems by installing the following requirements:

## Python

No specific requirements aside from raw python as well as an IDE of your choice.

## R

For the R tutorial, we need base R as well as the following packages

* [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)
* [r-simmer](https://r-simmer.org/)

An IDE of your choice is required as well. We recommend the usage of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for its excellent integration.

Note also, that `tidyverse` has several non-R dependencies that need to be installed beforehand if you are running Linux. This should not be required if running Windows or using a Mac.

`sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev`

After that, simply run `install.packages("tidyverse")` in RStudio to install the package.
